# HyperImmunISE

HyperImmunISE is a computational framework for designing glycan-mediated masking strategies to modulate protein immunogenicity.  
The platform integrates structural modelling, accessibility analysis, and rule-based site selection to support rational construct design.

It is intended for researchers in antibody engineering, vaccine design, and computational immunology who require reproducible, automatable workflows.
